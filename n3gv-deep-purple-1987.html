Like the levels of heaven or hell, music fans battle who’s the bigger fan, the guy with the band logo tattooed on his forearm, the one who bought each album the week it hit the streets, the fan with the most torn ticket stubs, the one with the most band merch or the one who makes mixes and mashups of the band’s songs.

I'm not five years old, and I don't need to be enraptured by glitzy 45 minute SFX feasts of erupting supervolcanoes and the mega-tsunami-earthquake-impact-snowball-ice-age-extinction-superflood of umpteen sixty-five Ma.

FNAF 3 introduced us to one of the most interesting characters in the series: Springtrap. People came up with theories on who he is such as "he's a hybrid of all the animatronics", and believed that his name would be either "Hybrid" or "Salvage" or even "Golden Bonnie" (which would all be true in a certain way).
