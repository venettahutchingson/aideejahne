Our High School principal is one of these few Mac users, and I have been unable to configure the print driver for a Samsung C2670 for the life of me.

Hi, My mom and dad is about to buy a cheap laser printer (no Airprint). They are asking, if they can print using iphone and ipad. The new printer does not have Wireless, only normal LAN connection. Can I just connect the new printer to the route with a LAN cable, do the configurations and then they can print using iphone/ipad (over wifi)?

I don't print very often, but prior to updating to SRM 1.2, printing to the HP printer plugged into my RT2600ac worked fine.

Use AirPrint to print wirelessly from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to an AirPrint-enabled printer without downloading additional software. We are on a network with about 15 printers and we are looking at making the switch to iPads for our field users. We need them to be able to print documents and forms to the office via the VPN.

However, my HP printer (OfficeJet Pro 7740) is only able to print when I switch back to the routers network. I've set up the printer on the AP's network and all of the HP assistant/installer wizards cannot find the printer when it is using the AP's IP. I would The only caveats here are (1) You need to have Java installed in Windows (which most people will) before installing Bonjour for Windows; and (2) You need to have the drivers for your printer installed in Windows before running the Bonjour Printer Wizard. 
I'm not really that familiar with Juniper, worked mostly Cisco during my tenuous career so I apologize if I missed something. The network is mostly comprised of Juniper EX4200/4500 switches and HP Pro-Curve. I've eliminated any HP switches being part of the problem for now and am just focusing on the Juniper side. Network setup is pretty straight forward. Printers, students, faculty, etc are all on their own VLANs. Data center has a switch core that is port channeled to each IDF switch.
